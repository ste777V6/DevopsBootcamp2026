Summary
Akhilesh Mishra led a session instructing participants on setting up the Linux environment using GitHub Codespaces for basic commands and an AWS EC2 instance for production-level labs in the DevOps boot camp, emphasizing the importance of virtualization for cloud environments. Akhilesh Mishra provided an overview of operating system history from Unix to Linux, explained architectural layers (hardware, kernel, shell), and detailed core Linux concepts, including environment variables, user and system-wide configurations, the functionality of the `PATH` variable, and key-based authentication for secure SSH access to remote VMs. After Dickson asked about hypervisor resource management, Akhilesh Mishra clarified that it pools and virtualizes resources, and in response to Shikhar Jain’s question about logging into a private VM without a key pair, Akhilesh Mishra promised to address that topic later in a dedicated networking class.

Details
Setting up the Linux Environment using GitHub Codespaces and AWS Akhilesh Mishra started the session by explaining how to use GitHub Codespaces for the basic Linux class, noting that it provides a free, temporary VS Code environment in the browser for Linux commands and code writing (00:00:00). For the current class, which focuses on Linux, especially for those with Windows machines, using Codespaces is beneficial (00:01:28). Later, Akhilesh Mishra instructed participants to use an AWS trial account to set up an EC2 machine, an Amazon Linux VM, which is necessary for the proper, production-level labs in the DevOps boot camp. This full control is considered essential for real-world learning, unlike limited lab environments (00:36:55).
Linux Historical Context and Architecture Akhilesh Mishra provided a history of operating systems, tracing back to the use of large servers from companies like IBM and HP in the 1990s, where applications ran on Unix (00:05:04). Unix was a multi-user, CPU-sharing operating system but was not free (00:06:07). The architecture of an operating system was explained as three layers: the physical hardware, the kernel (an interpreter for communicating with the hardware), and the shell (the UI component that reads human-readable commands) (00:07:31) (00:10:10).
Evolution of Operating Systems from Unix to Linux Unix later made its kernel open source to increase adoption. Companies like IBM (AIX) and HP (HP UX) created paid, proprietary versions based on the Unix kernel (00:07:31) (00:11:29). In the 1990s, Linus built the Linux kernel, inspired by the Unix kernel but released it as fully open source. This led to distributions like Red Hat (paid with support) and CentOS (free) (00:13:48). The paid support offered by Red Hat was a significant factor for mission-critical applications used by major companies (00:15:15). The adoption of free distributions like Ubuntu and Debian, and the open-source nature of Linux, made it the core technology of the IT world, running 90% of the world's applications, including iPhone and Android phones (00:17:46).
Shift from Physical Hardware to Virtualization Initially, running applications required purchasing large, expensive physical machines for each application (00:20:32). To address this cost and inefficiency, the concept of virtualization emerged using a hypervisor, which is installed on the physical hardware (00:21:35). The hypervisor allows the virtualization of physical resources like CPU and RAM, creating a resource pool from which multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) can be created and managed (00:23:00) (00:30:41). Dickson asked for clarification on whether the hypervisor duplicates or subdivides resources, to which Akhilesh Mishra clarified that it virtualizes and pools the resources, allowing them to be shared and flexibly allocated across multiple VMs (e.g., 1 CPU into 20 vCPUs) (00:23:00) (00:27:41).
Importance of Virtualization in the Cloud Domain The hypervisor technology enabled the creation of virtual machines (VMs) and virtual CPUs (vCPUs), which are now the standard in cloud environments like AWS (EC2). Akhilesh Mishra emphasized that this virtualization is why users can choose customized machine types and resource allocations, such as fractions of memory (e.g., 0.5 GB RAM) (00:24:52) (00:41:09). This history of virtualization is crucial for understanding concepts like Docker later in the boot camp (00:26:07) (00:42:13).
Authentication and Security in Linux VMs Akhilesh Mishra detailed the process of creating an EC2 VM, including the selection of an OS image (e.g., Amazon Linux) and machine type (capacity) (00:39:53). In a modern cloud environment, login security for a VM relies on key authentication rather than traditional username and password (00:43:54). This key-based method is more secure, preventing unauthorized access and data compromise, and the private key downloaded during creation must be protected (00:45:00).
Linux Shell Sessions and User Isolation After connecting to the newly created VM, Akhilesh Mishra demonstrated using the `who` and `whoami` commands to identify the user and active sessions (00:46:01). Multiple simultaneous sessions for the same user are isolated; for example, the command history is stored per shell session by default, not by the user (00:47:21).
Local Variables vs. Environment Variables in Linux Akhilesh Mishra introduced the concept of variables and environment variables (00:48:54). A normal variable assignment (e.g., `A=Akhilesh`) creates a local variable, which is only available within that specific shell session (00:50:36). Conversely, environment variables are local to the system, persistent across different users, and are essential in the DevOps world (00:52:02). Using the `export` command can elevate a local variable to an environment variable, visible when using the `env` command, but it remains specific to the current session (00:53:17). To make variables persistent across multiple sessions, they must be configured within specific Linux configuration files like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` (00:55:06).
Persisting Environment Variables Akhilesh Mishra demonstrated how to persist the value of an environment variable across multiple sessions using the `.bashrc` file. They instructed participants to use the `nano` editor to add an `export` command to the `.bashrc` file to ensure the variable's persistence (00:58:38). Akhilesh Mishra also noted that the `bashrc` file is local to each user, meaning other users will not see that variable's value (01:00:17).
User-Specific vs. System-Wide Configuration Akhilesh Mishra explained that user-specific configurations are handled by files in the user's home path, such as `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`, which are unique to each user (01:02:05). Conversely, system-wide behavior for all users is controlled by files like `/etc/profile`, which can only be modified by the root user. The speaker emphasized that modifying files in the home path is for single-user behavior, while modifying `/etc/profile` is for whole-system configuration (01:03:11).
Command Execution and Path Variable Akhilesh Mishra discussed how the Linux system executes commands by running corresponding files, which are often located in paths like `/usr/bin`. They explained that when a command fails, it might be because the system cannot locate the executable file (01:04:35) (01:09:14). Using the `which` command, like `which Python 3`, can reveal the exact path of the executable file, which can be used to run the command directly if the standard command fails (01:07:57).
Understanding the PATH Environment Variable Akhilesh Mishra highlighted the importance of the `PATH` environment variable for command lookup, demonstrating that when a command is executed, the system searches for the corresponding file sequentially in the directories listed in the `PATH` variable (01:09:14). They showed how to view the directories in the `PATH` variable using `echo $PATH`, noting that directories are separated by colons (01:10:37). Akhilesh Mishra emphasized that if an executable file is not in any of these paths, the system will report that the command does not exist (01:12:07).
Modifying the PATH Variable for Troubleshooting Akhilesh Mishra demonstrated how to temporarily modify the `PATH` environment variable using the `export` command to append a new directory, such as a user's home path, to the list of searchable locations. This allows the system to find and run executables located in the newly added path (01:13:30) (01:22:46). The speaker explained that this is crucial for troubleshooting issues where installed tools are not recognized by the system because their installation path is not included in the `PATH` (01:18:49).
Remote System Access using SSH Akhilesh Mishra introduced the use of the SSH protocol for securely logging into a remote Linux machine, such as an AWS EC2 instance, from a local terminal. To connect, one needs the remote machine's public IP address, which serves as its unique identity, and the corresponding private key file for authentication (01:35:23). Akhilesh Mishra detailed the SSH command structure: `ssh -i <key_file_name> <username>@<public_IP>` (01:37:59).
Setting Key Permissions and Multi-User Login Akhilesh Mishra instructed that before using the private key for SSH login, it must have specific permissions, demonstrated by running `chmod 400 <file_name>`, to ensure read-only permission for the user (01:37:59). They then successfully logged into the remote machine using the private key and facilitated a multi-user login demonstration by sharing the key file (01:39:50) (01:44:16). Akhilesh Mishra briefly mentioned "keyless authentication" as an alternative that they would discuss later (01:45:31).
Upcoming Project Work and Prerequisite Videos Akhilesh Mishra announced that the next session would focus on building a project involving scripting, passing and modifying log files, and remotely running files (01:41:13) (01:45:31). They stressed the importance of completing the fundamental Linux videos shared previously to ensure preparedness for the project-based class (01:45:31) (01:47:29). A participant, Shikhar Jain, raised a question about logging into a private VM without a key pair, to which Akhilesh Mishra responded that a random answer would not suffice and promised to address it in a future detailed networking class (01:48:43).

Suggested next steps
Akhilesh Mishra will send the link to the video that was previously mentioned.
The group will finish the video that Akhilesh Mishra sent on Linux because tomorrow Akhilesh Mishra will be building proper projects and will not be explaining the basic part.
